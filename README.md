Predicting Breast Cancer using Machine Learning
## 1. Problem Definition
In this project, we will be exploring binary classification.

We will be using a number of different features to predict whether a person have breast cancer or not.

## 2. Data
The original data comes from the Wisconsin database from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The original dataset contains 30 features, but only 10 features will be used in this project.

## 3. Evaluation
If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has breast cancer, we'll pursue this project

## 4. Features
Breast Cancer Data Dictionary
Below is a list of features we will use to predict the target variable (breast cancer or no breast cancer).

* radius_mean - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
* texture_mean - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
* perimeter_mean - mean size of the core tumor
* area_mean - area
* smoothness_mean - mean of local variation in radius lengths
* compactness_mean - (mean of perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
* concavity_mean - (severity of concave portions of the contour)
* concave points_mean (number of concave portions of the contour)
* symmetry_mean
* fractal dimension_mean ("coastline approximation" - 1)
